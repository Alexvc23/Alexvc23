## üèÜ Projects

### Minishell-42

- **[Minishell-42](https://github.com/Alexvc23/minishell-42)** - This project is an implementation of a Bash shell, completed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of shell functionality and programming, with features that mirror those found in a traditional Bash shell.

### Net Practice

- **[net-practice](https://github.com/Alexvc23/net_practice)** - A project dedicated to understanding the nuances of the TCP/IP protocol and address formatting. It offers deep insights into networking protocols, and it's a demonstration of my ability to grasp complex networking concepts.

### Cub3D

- **[Cub3D](https://github.com/Alexvc23/cub3d)** - This project showcases a raycasting engine reminiscent of early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D. Developed in collaboration with Elsruora who handled the parsing, it uses the Minilibx library provided by the 42 school. The project provides insight into graphics programming, specifically line drawing techniques, and rendering in C using the Minilibx library.

### Born2beroot

- **[Born2beroot](https://github.com/Alexvc23/born2beroot)** - In this project, I worked with virtualization to install Linux Debian in VirtualBox and set it up for server use. This exercise provided valuable hands-on experience with Linux server configuration and virtualization technologies.

### Pipex

The program's behavior is akin to the command < infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile in a shell.

### Philosophers

- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/Alexvc23/philosophers)** - This project provides a deep understanding of the difference between processes and threads, manipulation of shared memory spaces, and working with threads. It also introduces concepts like mutex and semaphores, fundamental to understanding and managing concurrent programming.

### Gmail Wipeout
