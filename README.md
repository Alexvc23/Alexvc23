## üèÜ Projects

### ft_transcendence

- **[ft_transcendence](https://github.com/Alexvc23/ft_transcendence)** - As part of the 42 school curriculum, I developed ft_transcendence, a website for Pong competition. This project involved creating a single-page application with real-time multiplayer Pong games, integrated chat, and user account management, showcasing my skills in web development, responsive design, and real-time data handling. Developed using NestJS for backend, a TypeScript framework for frontend, and PostgreSQL for database management.

### Minishell-42

- **[Minishell-42](https://github.com/Alexvc23/minishell-42)** - This project is an implementation of a Bash shell, completed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of shell functionality and programming, with features that mirror those found in a traditional Bash shell.

### Cub3D

- **[Cub3D](https://github.com/Alexvc23/cub3d)** - This project showcases a raycasting engine reminiscent of early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D. Developed in collaboration with Elsruora who handled the parsing, it uses the Minilibx library provided by the 42 school. The project provides insight into graphics programming, specifically line drawing techniques, and rendering in C using the Minilibx library.

### Born2beroot

- **[Born2beroot](https://github.com/Alexvc23/born2beroot)** - In this project, I worked with virtualization to install Linux Debian in VirtualBox and set it up for server use. This exercise provided valuable hands-on experience with Linux server configuration and virtualization technologies.

### Pipex

- **[Pipex](https://github.com/Alexvc23/42_pipex_2022)** - Pipex is a project that reproduces the behavior of the Unix shell's pipe '|' command in C, utilizing pipe(), fork(), dup2(), access(), and execve() functions. The program's behavior is akin to the command < infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile in a shell.

### Philosophers

- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/Alexvc23/philosophers)** - This project provides a deep understanding of the difference between processes and threads, manipulation of shared memory spaces, and working with threads. It also introduces concepts like mutex and semaphores, fundamental to understanding and managing concurrent programming.

### Gmail Wipeout

- **[gmail_wipeout](https://github.com/Alexvc23/wipe_out_gmail)** - This script enables authentication into the Gmail API to delete all unread emails. It provides a practical demonstration of interacting with external APIs and automating email management tasks.
